*DESCRIPTION*:Quiz – A Fun and Interactive Quiz App

“Quiz” is a simple, fun, and interactive web-based quiz application that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal behind this project was to build something educational yet enjoyable—something that tests knowledge while keeping users engaged. It’s great for casual users, students, or even friends who want to challenge each other.

The app starts with a clean and modern interface. Once you hit "Start", questions appear one by one, and each comes with four options. The user selects an answer and immediately sees whether it’s right or wrong. To keep things exciting, there's a timer for each question, which adds a bit of pressure and encourages quick thinking—just like in a real quiz competition!

One of my favorite features is the leaderboard. After finishing the quiz, users are taken to a separate page where they can see their scores and compare them with others who’ve played. The scores are saved in the browser’s local storage, which means they don’t disappear when the page is refreshed or reopened. This adds a competitive edge and motivates users to come back and try to beat their previous scores.

I’ve put a lot of thought into making the app visually appealing and easy to use. The styling is done with CSS, using a modern color palette, smooth transitions, and responsive design principles so it looks good on phones, tablets, and computers. Whether someone’s playing on a laptop or a mobile device, the experience stays consistent and user-friendly.

Behind the scenes, the main logic of the quiz is handled by JavaScript. It manages the question flow, keeps track of the score, handles timing, and updates the leaderboard. All the questions are stored in a simple array of objects, which makes it easy to update or add new ones in the future. The whole project is structured to be clean, lightweight, and easy to maintain.

This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, especially working with the DOM, handling events, and using local storage. It also gave me a chance to think about how to improve the user experience—like giving instant feedback, keeping the layout intuitive, and encouraging replayability.

Overall, “Quiz” is more than just a coding exercise—it's a full-featured mini app that reflects both my technical skills and creative approach. It’s something I had a lot of fun building, and I hope users enjoy playing it just as much.
